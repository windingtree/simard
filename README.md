# Simard

Simard is a set of tools developed by Winding Tree (via Simard subsidiary) in an attempt to gradually introduce blockchain-enabled optimizations (starting with identity and payments) to the corporate travel sector. We partnered with a few airlines, hotels, and one of the "big four" consulting companies acting as a buyer.

## Simard Components
